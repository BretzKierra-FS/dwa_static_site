      content:
        ' JavaScript leverages asynchronous operations to perform tasks that were traditionally reserved for the back end. This includes making HTTP requests, handling databases, and managing real-time data. Libraries like Axios and the built-in fetch API enable developers to send requests to servers and process responses without requiring a page refresh. This allows for dynamic and responsive front-end experiences.',

Frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue provide powerful routing mechanisms that let you control what content is displayed in the browser based on the URL.
